PATTERN DISPATCHER
*filetering methods based on their names in class is called pattern dispatching.

Note:
*Send() can call any method including private method but it breaks the encapsulation and new method public_send() which respects the receiver privacy.

*obj.send(:method_name,arg1) --method name can be strings or symbols,symbols will be considered //ruby is sending name of method to object

Difference Between String and Symmbol
*Symbols are immutable ,we can change characters inside the string but we cant do in symbols	
*comparison is faster in symbols than string

Advantage:
using send we can wait until last minute to pass the method name in to send function so that particular method will be called at run time while
code is running is called Dynamic Dispatch

How to use Define method ?
we can define method dynamically using define_method
when define method is executed it creates method hello at run time it is called Dynamic method
class Dynmethod

	define_method :hello do |x,y|
		"hello #{x} and #{y}"
	end
end

dyn=Dynmethod.new
puts dyn.hello("vinod","sabari")


METHOD MISSING
*when a unknown method ,ruby searches it in base class and searches up to ancestor chain up to object and then enters in to kernel.
*if ruby does not find the method anywhere then it admit the failure by surrendering in to method_missing() method which is instance method of Kernel .which every object inherits

*if we call method_missing() using send() then you will be getting an error saying "No Method Found error" hence only solution is to override 
method_missing() 

class Hunter
	def method_missing(method_name,*args)
 	  puts "method name #{method_name} is called with arguments (#{args.join(',')})"
 	  puts block_given?
	end
end

hunt=Hunter.new
hunt.vinod 82,180 do
puts "this is block"
end

GHOST METHODS
"if they ask you something and you dont understand do this"
method that is processed by method_missing() seems regular call from callers side but there is no corresponding method on receiver side this is called Ghost method.
*ghost methods are rows_wtih_country()

*open structs is magicof ghost methods if you want a new hash just assign the object with value ,
*= calls missing method and binds the value with attribute and returns as hash
