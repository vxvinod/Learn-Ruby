PATTERN DISPATCHER
*filetering methods based on their names in class is called pattern dispatching.

Note:
*Send() can call any method including private method but it breaks the encapsulation and new method public_send() which respects the receiver privacy.

*obj.send(:method_name,arg1) --method name can be strings or symbols,symbols will be considered //ruby is sending name of method to object

Difference Between String and Symmbol
*Symbols are immutable ,we can change characters inside the string but we cant do in symbols	
*comparison is faster in symbols than string

Advantage:
using send we can wait until last minute to pass the method name in to send function so that particular method will be called at run time while
code is running is called Dynamic Dispatch

How to use Define method ?
we can define method dynamically using define_method
when define method is executed it creates method hello at run time it is called Dynamic method
class Dynmethod

	define_method :hello do |x,y|
		"hello #{x} and #{y}"
	end
end

dyn=Dynmethod.new
puts dyn.hello("vinod","sabar
