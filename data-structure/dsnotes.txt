TREE collection

Ruby doesn't have nor need pointers since most things are simply passed by reference.

> a = "hello"
> b = a
> a.object_id == b.object_id
=> true 
In its simplest form a tree node could just be a struct, with a parent and a left and right sibling:

> Node = Struct.new(:parent, :left, :right)
> root = Node.new
> n1   = Node.new(root, "hello", "world")
> root.left = n1
...

> root.left.left
=> "hello"
> root.left.right
=> "world"
